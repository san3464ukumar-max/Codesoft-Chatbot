📌 RuleBot – Simple Python Chatbot

A beginner-friendly rule-based chatbot built using Python.
This chatbot responds to user inputs using keyword matching and provides predefined answers for greetings, farewells, jokes, questions, and more.

🚀 Features

✔️ Responds to greetings (hello, hi, hey…)
✔️ Answers common user questions (name, age, origin, hobbies, etc.)
✔️ Responds to help-related queries
✔️ Tells jokes
✔️ Provides default fallback responses
✔️ Fully written in Python (no extra libraries needed)
✔️ Runs in the terminal (command-line interface)

🧠 How It Works

RuleBot uses simple conditional logic (if-elif statements) and keyword matching to reply to user inputs.
It is not AI-powered — instead, it follows rules you define.

✔ Example interaction:
You: hello
RuleBot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: tell me a joke
RuleBot: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!
